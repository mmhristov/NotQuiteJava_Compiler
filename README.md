# NotQuiteJava compiler #
This project was done as a portfolio
exam for the lecture "Compiler and Language Processing Tools",
held by Prof. Dr. Annette Bieniusa during the winter semester of 2022/2023.
The task was to extend a compiler template, provided by
Mr. Albert Schimpf, with object-oriented
constructs.

## Extensions: ##
- Parsing, analysis and translation of classes
    - bonus: parsing and analysis of inheritance
- Parsing, analysis and translation of interfaces
- Parsing and analysis of multidimensional arrays
