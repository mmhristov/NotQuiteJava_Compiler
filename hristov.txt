Grade: 1.7

Documentation:

+ Introduction in the beginning with an overview
+ Text is nicely structured and reads well
+ Use of code snippets to highlight ideas and their explanation
- Sketches and examples would have been helpful.

Reflection:

- Reflection has structure but could use some subsections or paragraphs.
+ Discussion of known limitations 




Implementation:

Good implementation, missing multi-dimensional arrays.

Parser
- class arrays not parseable

Analysis
- null handling for methods and fields
- fields are unique check missing
- interface implementations are covariant in their return type
- interface parameters are invariant
- interface and classes share their namespace
- duplicate interface implements check

Translation
- global functions called from OO code not working
- stateful get procedure breaks block scoping
- errors from analysis affects translation
