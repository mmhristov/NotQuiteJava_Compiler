\section{Known Problems}
\label{sec:problems}
As the time we had on our disposal was in no means sufficient 
to build a perfect compiler, this project is not devoid of errors and mistakes.
Moreover, it can be viewed as a first iteration, in which
we get a better picture of what the more difficult parts of building
a compiler are, which modeling abstractions work and which do not.
In this section, some known problems of our compiler are listed.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The translation of multidimensional arrays has not been implemented
    \item Polymorphism of interface objects does not work (see failing tests \cite{repository})
    \item Translator has issues with interface objects as parameters to a function
        when no prior assignment of the class object to an interface variable exists (see failing tests\cite{repository})
\end{itemize}
